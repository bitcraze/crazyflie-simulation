# crazyflie-simulation

This repo contains a very minimal simulation setup for the Crazyflie. It's not actively maintained, and not very realistic in terms of dynamics. That said, it might still be useful for simple tests, demos, or inspiration.

It includes low-resolution meshes based on the Crazyflie 2.1. These are intentionally simplified to reduce vertex count, making them lightweight enough to simulate many units at once.


## Installation

See the  [installation instructions](/docs/installing/) in the Github docs folder.

## Official documentation

More details can be found in the [Bitcraze crazyflie-simulation documentation](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-simulation/main/).
